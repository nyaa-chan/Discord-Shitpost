# Discord-Shitpost

Just a really bad bot written in python, nothing to see here.

## Introduction

This bot was originaly made to take an image that a user submits and overlays the dio walk meme template to it. I saw it in a meme somewhere but it didn't exist so I made it myself. :)

If you just want this bot in your server click on this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=676919574679257158&permissions=52224&scope=bot

## Installation

* Requires Python 3.8 or later

First you must make sure you have a bot account with Discord. If you dont know how to do that a detailed walkthrough can be found here https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html

Now clone the repository and navigate to the directory with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nyaa-chan/Discord-Shitpost
```

Or download the repository as a zip archive and extract on your computer.

Once you have the repository on your computer simply run the start.bat file, it will install all required libraries, ask for your token, then run the bot script.

## Commands

* The default command start is "." but this can be changed in the config file.

Working commands are as follows:

* "diowalk": the reason this bot exists, see intoduction.
* "leave": mostly a debug command, stops the bot script so you can safely make changes to the code.
