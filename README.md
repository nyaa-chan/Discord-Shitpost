# Discord-Shitpost

Just a really bad bot written in python, nothing to see here.

## Introduction

This bot was originaly made to take an image that a user submits and overlays the dio walk meme template to it. I saw it in a meme somewhere but it didn't exist so I made it myself. :)

## Installation

* Requires Python 3.8 or later

First you must make sure you have a bot account with Discord. If you dont know how to do that a detailed walkthrough can be found here https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html

Now clone the repository and navigate to the directory with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nyaa-chan/Discord-Shitpost
cd Discord-Shitpost
```

Then install the required libraries with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Navigate to the config file and open it with your favored text editor, then paste your bot's token into the labeled line (with the quotations around the token).

Now just run core.py under the bot folder and you're good to go!

## Commands

* The default command start is "." but this can be changed in the config file.

Working commands are as follows:

* "diowalk": the reason this bot exists, see intoduction.
* "leave": mostly a debug command, stops the bot script so you can safely make changes to the code.
